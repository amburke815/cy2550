After Prof. Shelat recommended DashLane in class, I was interested to use it. I've been working on migrating my account passwords to be used with dashlane and so far am impressed with how easy it is to use.
I have come to value my privacy more and more this summer as my phone was randomly wiped and shut down for a month, and when I finally got it to work again I had accounts that I couldn't sign into, it freaked me out.
I started storing my passwords in plaintext in a usb but after going through the first month of CY2500 I realized that was a bad approach, so thanks for making this useful info a part of the project!
